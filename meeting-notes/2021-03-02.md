What we've been up to:

 * @rvagg:
     - Added exploration report on making small deals with Filecoin, thanks to lots of feedback and clearing up details from others (@ribasushi, @dirkmc, and others) https://github.com/protocol/w3dt-sudo/pull/2
         - Made 3 successful deals for a small file, spent $0.90 in the process, learned a lot.
     - Have been simplifying the "Filecoin basics" for some learning material
     - Messed up our server (rusty AWS skills let me down), it's back running again with a re-installed Lotus
     - Wrote up a couple of project proposals arising out of my thinking about small-deals:
         - [Clearing house / batching service protocol](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/pull/60)
         - [DealScript](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/pull/61)
 * @vasco-santos:
     - store-my-app scafold
         - lerna [monorepo](https://github.com/vasco-santos/store-my-text) created
         - cra based [web-app](https://github.com/vasco-santos/store-my-text/tree/master/packages/www) with minimal form for submitting text + email
         - minimal [server](https://github.com/vasco-santos/store-my-text/tree/master/packages/server) with REST API
     - Lotus CLI and docs exploration
     - Started playing with [lotus js client](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client)
         - Tested [alanshaw/js-lotus-client-examples](https://github.com/alanshaw/js-lotus-client-examples) with our deployed lotus node, instead of chain.love
         - Creating some notes on this
 * @achingbrain:
     - TypeScript + js-ipfs
     - js-ipfs maintenance - finding broken HTTP APIs w/ binary - triage team agreed we should accept multibase
     - IPFS HTTP API - gRPC is in js-ipfs (experimental) - need to build it out fully & get it into go-ipfs - will get proposal up for this work
 * @dirkmc:
     - w/ Ignite - improving deal success rate - creating integration & testground tests to measure status
     - Watching the small-deals & general deal-making problems and trying to figure out how we're tackling it collectively

## Discussion topics

 * Lotus API tokens + Wallet
     - A lotus node accepts read JSON-RPC requests, but needs tokens for write
         - We need write tokens for storing
     - Gap between wallet and lotus node
         - [Possible approach](https://hackmd.io/iZJacRQmSN-obAjEypEanw)
 * Misleading/outdated docs
     - Found [misleading docs](https://docs.filecoin.io/build/lotus/#getting-started-with-lotus-apis) when attempting to get the js client to use our lotus
     - Lotus auth cli for api info `lotus auth api-info --perm read` returns the info with the token, but no token needed ðŸ¤·
     - Should we have a way of cataloguing this feedback and get it to the onboarding team?
         - We can also PR, but we might not have the clear picture yet
 * JS maintenance
     - Working out roles and responsibilities for maintenance of the JS stack and how to prioritise it - ongoing discussions with Jacob & Stewards
